title: A quantum mechanical treatment of <del>Hydrogen</del> everything
---
> Ch 10 page 512: Exchange integrals result from MOs being described as linear combination of AOs (superpositions!) - they add significant negative potential to the overall bond energy as a function of R, and without them there would be no negative potential energy well at any R. Thus the mere existence of the stable chemical bond is a quantum mechanical effect. 

I was studying for my QM final recently when I read something similar to the above quote from McQuarrie and Simon's *Quantum Chemistry*, second edition. I'd like to stress how important I think that last line is (I mean c'mon I'm writing an entire post about it). "the *mere existence* of the stable chemical bond is a quantum mechanical effect." (emphasis added for emphasis and stuff). 

### It's all about scale

Truth be told I guess I've known the importance of QM since week 3 of Chem 4A, but it took something as decisive as that, in the words of Babak, "**bold** statement!" to really make it hit home. Without QM, chemistry and physics have no real predictive power (I'm just ignoring relativity as a whole, haven't studied it yet). Without QM, atoms could not exist, matter could not be stable... life as we know it would change fundamentally. This stuff is *real*. And I know how that sounds. But without QM, chemistry really is just a toy. It wouldn't be a hard science. Sure, there's some rules we follow in organic that work most of the time. But if there's no explanation for why or how, then the rules are arrived at by intuition or trial and error - and there's no reason we should take them as fact. Those in the know will by now be saying the same thing about quantum theory - there's no real explanation for why it works. But as a body of work it is self consistent, precisely represents experimental data, and has never been disproven. The general consensus since the 1920s has been that it is an accepted way of modelling nature. 

I should mention here that the whole of classical mechanics is not useless! We've gotten away with thousands of years of kinematics and classical electromagnetism precisely because they work as predictive tools *at the scales that are useful to daily life.* It's not a **bold** statement to say that humans are classical creatures. Our intuition is naturally steeped in what we can see and experience in our daily lives, and this is precisely what breaks down when we start to study systems that are governed by quantum mechanical effects. As the energy and size of particles get larger and larger (eg. on the scale of you there, reading this), the [Correspondence Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle) tells us that the expected values for quantum mechanical observables must agree with their classical counterparts. So in long averages you can "smoothly" proceed from the classical to quantum realms of operation. 

### The most quantum of the quanta

Spin is arguably one of the most

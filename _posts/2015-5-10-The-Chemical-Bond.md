title: A quantum mechanical treatment of H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>
---

Ch 10 page 512: Exchange integrals result from MOs being described as linear combination of AOs (superpositions!) - they add significant negative potential to the overall bond energy as a function of R, and without them there would be no negative potential energy well at any R. Thus the mere existence of the stable chemical bond is a quantum mechanical effect. 

Now I just have to look for a neat way to add LaTeX support...More to come.
